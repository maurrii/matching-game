The game I selected to create is a memory game called easy match. I picked this game because I am new to software development and without any prior knowledge in coding I knew it would be a good start for me. Using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS to create this game was a fun challenge; Css is a little boring. a part I need to  enhance. My skills are  hope you enjoy playing it as much as I did creating it.

and here is a picture of my actual game 

### Technology used:
  * HTML
  * JavaScript
  * Css

Some things I would love to add to my game is to be able to shuffle the cards after the game, be able to flip the cards in a 3d sense, create more cards to play with

#### Pseudocode for the overall game

Display 9 boxes across the screen.
Duplicate the cards to have 2 sets and a main.
Add the style to the cards, showing the back of the card first.
Create a function to allow two cards to be able to flip at a time.
Determine if the two selected cards are a match and if not set a timer to hide all of the cards flipped.
If all of the cards are matched create win game function with a reset button to restart the game.
