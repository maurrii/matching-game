The game I selected to create is a memory game called easy match. I picked this game because I am new to software development and without any prior knowledge in coding I knew it would be a good start for me. Using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS to create this game was a fun challenge; Css is a little boring. a part I need to  enhance. My skills are  hope you enjoy playing it as much as I did creating it.

Its a Easy game (hint:easy match) flip two cards until you get a match to win the game.
